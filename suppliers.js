Today, over 50 years later, Browning’s is still known for these traits, as well as its offerings of a wide variety of medical equipment and supplies to aid a range of healthcare needs.\n\n“We are all proud to have been here so long,” says Colleen Hunter, George Browning’s youngest daughter, who took over operations of Browning’s in 2011. Hunter holds a master’s degree in accounting from the University of Florida and worked as CFO of the company for 17 years prior to assuming the role as president.","headline":"Serving Florida’s Medical Equipment and Pharmacy Needs Since 1962","service_area":"FL","go_live_date":"2025-03-12","active":true,"created_at":"2025-03-10T22:24:39.192Z","updated_at":"2025-08-31T00:23:18.023Z","created_by_retool_id":37,"udpated_by_retool_id":37,"owned_by_retool_id":null,"product_categories":"Oxygen,CPAP & BiLevel,Continued Use & Benefit,Incontinence,Hospital Beds,Mobility,Ambulatory,Nebulizer,Service Requests,Orthotics,Urology,Ostomy,Aids to Daily Living,Toilet & Bath,Compression,Suction/Trach,Wound Care,Nursing Supplies,O2 Recert and Revision,Skin Care,Ventilators","is_supplier_org":false},{"id":533,"name":"Carmichael's Cashway Pharmacy, Inc","external_id":"DT-QGX9-VA-PQ-EB","url":"carmichaels","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammyatparachute/ph-marketing-site-images/main/Carmichaels%20Brand%20Logo.png","description":"Our inventory consists primarily of products for patient-administered home care, such as ambulatory equipment; hospital beds and supplies; diabetic shoes and supplies; bath aids; respiratory therapy equipment, supplies and services, including oxygen concentrators and portable cylinders, continuous and bilevel positive airway pressure equipment and nebulizers; orthopedic products; ostomy; prosthetics; and supplements and nutritionals.","headline":"You can always depend on Carmichael’s","service_area":"LA","go_live_date":"2025-03-11","active":true,"created_at":"2025-03-10T20:12:51.591Z","updated_at":"2025-08-31T00:24:33.147Z","created_by_retool_id":50,"udpated_by_retool_id":50,"owned_by_retool_id":null,"product_categories":"CPAP & BiLevel,Mobility,Urology,Oxygen,Ostomy,Enteral,Hospital Beds,Incontinence,Ambulatory,Continued Use & Benefit,Nebulizer,Suction/Trach,Orthotics,Prosthetics,Aids to Daily Living,Toilet & Bath,O2 Recert and Revision,Ventilators,Diabetes","is_supplier_org":false},{"id":532,"name":"Shan Medical Equipment (An Al-Khafaji Company)","external_id":"FKLYR-R8-A7S-EV0","url":"shanmedicalequip","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sammyatparachute/ph-marketing-site-images/refs/heads/main/bwSMELogo (1).png","description":"Our business is your good health.
